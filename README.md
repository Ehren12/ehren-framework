# ehren-framework

This CSS framework is really lovely solving the issue of getting a css library and not knowing what class names to use when styling your page.
It uses very simple, yet powerful, class names to acheive that beutiful design you want. For example I can change a buttons color by adding the class "green" just to make the button
green.

This Project is still in its developer beta for now so pls be the first to try it and please give me your feedback. If u want u can add or customize the framework.

Leave your thoughts Thank you!
